# SESSION CHANGELOG - Phase 3: MindsDB Integration
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Session Focus:** Connecting Phoenix to MindsDB and configuring character agents  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Original Plan (from Rebuild Document)

**Phase 3: MindsDB Integration (Days 11-15)**
- Task 3.1: MindsDB Connection Setup via PostgreSQL wire protocol (Postgrex)
- Task 3.2: Upload Permaculture PDFs to MindsDB
- Task 3.3: Create All Seven MindsDB Agents
- Task 3.4: Agent Memory System
- Task 3.5: Context Builder for Agents
- Task 3.6: Chat Interface Integration

---

## 🔄 What Actually Happened

### Major Deviation: PostgreSQL → HTTP API Switch

**Original Plan:** Use Postgrex to connect to MindsDB via PostgreSQL wire protocol (port 47335/47340)

**What We Did:** Switched to MindsDB HTTP API (port 47334) using Req library

**Why the Change:**
- MindsDB's PostgreSQL wire protocol implementation is non-standard
- Postgrex couldn't parse MindsDB's protocol responses
- Error: `FunctionClauseError in Postgrex.Messages.parse/3`
- SSL negotiation failures even with `ssl: false`
- Multiple attempts to fix Postgrex connection all failed

**Decision Rationale:**
- User insisted on solving connection issues before proceeding (to avoid technical debt)
- HTTP API is MindsDB's documented, stable interface
- Simpler implementation, easier to maintain
- Already had Req in dependencies (project standard)

---

## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Solutions

### Issue 1: MindsDB Container Port Confusion
**Problem:** MindsDB was mapped to port 47340, but documentation referenced 47335  
**Root Cause:** Docker port mapping: `47340:47335`  
**Solution:** Updated all config to use 47340  
**Time Lost:** ~15 minutes

### Issue 2: Postgrex SSL Negotiation Failure
**Problem:** `connection refused` and `invalid response to SSL negotiation: U`  
**Attempts:**
1. Added `ssl: false` to config - FAILED
2. Tried `psql --no-ssl` - FAILED (unsupported flag)
3. Tried direct connection string with `sslmode=disable` - FAILED
**Root Cause:** MindsDB's PostgreSQL protocol implementation incompatible with standard clients  
**Time Lost:** ~45 minutes

### Issue 3: Database Migration Failure
**Problem:** `ArgumentError: invalid time unit :native`  
**Root Cause:** Elixir 1.18.2 + OTP 25 + Ecto 3.13 incompatibility  
**Attempted Fixes:**
1. Downgrade Ecto to 3.11 - FAILED (phoenix_ecto requires 3.13+)
2. Remove mix.lock and force resolution - FAILED
**Decision:** Deferred migration fix, proceeded with connection work  
**Status:** UNRESOLVED (migration still pending)  
**Time Lost:** ~30 minutes

### Issue 4: HTTP Response Parsing
**Problem:** MindsDB API returns nested list format: `%{"data" => [["answer"]]}`  
**Evolution:**
1. First attempt: Expected `%{"data" => [%{"answer" => "..."}]}`
2. Second attempt: Expected `[["answer"]]` but tried `Map.get` on list
3. Third attempt: Pattern matched `[[answer | _] | _]` but only handled binary input
4. Final solution: Pattern match on both binary (string) and map (Req auto-parses JSON)

**Solution:**
```elixir
defp decode_body(body) when is_binary(body) do
  # Handle JSON string
end

defp decode_body(%{"data" => data, "type" => "table"}) do
  # Handle pre-parsed map from Req
  case data do
    [[answer | _] | _] when is_binary(answer) -> {:ok, answer}
  end
end
```
**Time Lost:** ~20 minutes

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 3.1: MindsDB Connection (MODIFIED)
**Original:** Postgrex-based PostgreSQL connection  
**Actual:** Req-based HTTP API connection  
**Implementation:**
- Created `GreenManTavern.MindsDB.Client` module
- Functions: `test_connection/0`, `query_agent/3`, `list_agents/0`
- Structured logging with Logger
- Safe SQL escaping for query parameters
- Error handling for HTTP failures

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/green_man_tavern/mindsdb/client.ex` (complete rewrite)
- `config/dev.exs` (changed port config)
- `config/config.exs` (added HTTP port)
- `config/prod.exs` (added HTTP port with env vars)
- `config/runtime.exs` (runtime HTTP port config)
- `lib/green_man_tavern/application.ex` (removed from supervision tree)

### ✅ Task 3.2: Upload PDFs (USER COMPLETED)
**Status:** User had already uploaded ~12 PDFs, then completed remaining uploads  
**Note:** Attempted to provide free PDF links, but most were broken  
**Decision:** User proceeded with their own PDF collection

### ✅ Task 3.3: Create Seven Agents (USER COMPLETED)
**Status:** User had already created all 7 character agents in MindsDB  
**Agents:**
1. student_agent
2. grandmother_agent
3. farmer_agent
4. robot_agent
5. alchemist_agent
6. survivalist_agent
7. hobo_agent

**Verified:** Agent queries work via MindsDB web interface (port 47334)

### ✅ Task 3.4: Test Agents
**Method:** Direct query via Phoenix IEx  
**Test Query:**
```elixir
context = %{
  user_location: "Zone 8b",
  user_space: "small backyard",
  user_skill: "beginner"
}

GreenManTavern.MindsDB.Client.query_agent(
  "student_agent",
  "What are the basics of composting?",
  context
)
```

**Result:**
```elixir
{:ok, "Oh, composting! What a foundational element of permaculture..."}
```

**Character Response Quality:** Excellent - The Student's personality (curious, encouraging documentation) came through clearly

### ⏸️ Task 3.5: Agent Memory System (DEFERRED)
**Status:** Not implemented in this session  
**Reason:** Focused on core connection first; memory can be added later  
**Plan:** Will implement when building character chat interfaces (Phase 2)

### ⏸️ Task 3.6: Chat Interface Integration (DEFERRED)
**Status:** Not implemented in this session  
**Reason:** Part of character pages (Phase 2), not MindsDB connection  
**Plan:** Will implement when building LiveView character pages

---

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

### 1. HTTP API Over PostgreSQL Protocol
**Decision:** Use MindsDB HTTP API (port 47334) instead of PostgreSQL wire protocol  
**Rationale:**
- Standard, documented interface
- Avoids Postgrex compatibility issues
- Simpler to debug and maintain
- Better error messages

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ No connection pooling (HTTP is stateless)
- ❌ Slightly higher latency per request
- ✅ More reliable connection
- ✅ Easier to understand/debug
- ✅ No protocol parsing issues

### 2. Req Over HTTPoison
**Decision:** Use Req library for HTTP requests  
**Rationale:**
- Already in project dependencies
- Project standard (per coding guidelines)
- Modern, ergonomic API
- Auto-parses JSON responses

### 3. Defer Migration Fix
**Decision:** Proceed with development despite pending migration  
**Rationale:**
- Migration issue is separate from MindsDB connection
- Would require OTP upgrade or complex Ecto workaround
- Not blocking current development
- Can be fixed later without affecting MindsDB work

**Risk:** Will need to resolve before production deployment

### 4. Git Rollback Tags
**Decision:** Create rollback tags before major changes  
**Implementation:**
- `rollback-before-http-client` (before switching to HTTP)
- `rollback-after-http-client` (after HTTP client working)
- `rollback-before-http-config-audit` (before config standardization)
- `rollback-after-http-config-standardization` (after config cleanup)

**Benefit:** Easy to revert if issues arise

## 📊 Time Tracking

| Task | Estimated | Actual | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Connection Setup | 1 hour | 2.5 hours | Postgrex issues added 1.5hrs |
| Upload PDFs | 30 min | 0 min | User completed beforehand |
| Create Agents | 2 hours | 0 min | User completed beforehand |
| Test Agents | 30 min | 30 min | Response parsing iterations |
| Config Cleanup | 30 min | 20 min | Straightforward |
| **Total** | **4.5 hours** | **3 hours** | |

**Note:** Despite Postgrex detour, we saved time because user had PDFs/agents ready

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. When to Abandon a Failing Approach
**Situation:** Spent 45+ minutes trying to fix Postgrex connection  
**Lesson:** After 3-4 failed attempts with a library/protocol, consider alternative approaches  
**Applied:** Switched to HTTP API after Postgrex failures  
**Result:** Working connection in 30 minutes

### 2. User's Insistence on Fixing Issues Was Correct
**User's Concern:** "Don't want to create bottlenecks by deferring connection issues"  
**Outcome:** User was RIGHT - connection issues would have been harder to debug later  
**Lesson:** Core infrastructure (DB connections, APIs) should be solid before building features

### 3. Response Format Assumptions
**Mistake:** Assumed MindsDB would return data in one specific format  
**Reality:** API returned nested lists: `[["answer"]]` not `[%{"answer" => "..."}]`  
**Lesson:** Always inspect actual API responses before implementing parsing logic  
**Tool:** Using `inspect()` in IEx revealed actual structure

### 4. Elixir/OTP Version Compatibility Matters
**Issue:** Ecto 3.13 requires OTP 26 for `:native` time unit  
**Impact:** Blocked database migrations  
**Lesson:** Check Elixir/OTP compatibility matrix before updating dependencies  
**Future:** May need to upgrade OTP to 26 or pin Ecto to 3.11
