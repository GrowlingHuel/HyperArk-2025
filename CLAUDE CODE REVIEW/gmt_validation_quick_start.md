## üìã STEP 1: Create Project Standards Document (5 min)

Create this file in your project root:

**File**: `.claude/project_standards.md`

```markdown
# Green Man Tavern - Code Standards & Conventions

## Core Architecture
- **LiveView ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Database**: No direct queries from LiveViews
- **User Ownership**: All user-scoped queries filter by user_id
- **Personality-Driven**: Characters have distinct voices
- **Greyscale Only**: No colors except for accessibility (#000-#FFF range)

## Key Components
- **Seven Seekers**: Student, Grandmother, Farmer, Robot, Alchemist, Survivalist, Hobo
- **Systems Flow Diagram**: Database-backed node visualization
- **Quest System**: Character-driven progression
- **Achievement System**: Milestone tracking
- **MindsDB Integration**: AI agents for character intelligence

## Naming Rules
- Modules: GreenManTavern.Domain.Module
- Contexts: GreenManTavern.Domain (no :context suffix)
- LiveViews: [Name]Live
- Tables: snake_case plural (users, user_systems)
- Functions: snake_case

## Database Rules
- All tables: inserted_at, updated_at timestamps
- All foreign keys: ON DELETE strategy specified
- All FK columns: Have indexes
- User-scoped data: Filter by user_id in queries

## Testing Minimum
- Contexts: >80% test coverage
- LiveViews: Happy path + error cases
- Integration: Full user journey tested

## Security Rules
- Authenticate before showing protected pages
- Filter all user-scoped data by current_user_id
- Validate all server-side form input
- Sanitize user content before display
- Never show other users' data

## Session Management
- Sessions timeout: 24 hours
- CSRF protection: On all forms
- HTTPS: Enforced in production
- Password requirements: Min 12 chars, strong

## Character Agent Integration
- Agents access only current_user's data
- Responses cached for 5 minutes
- Fallback to rule-based if MindsDB slow
- All agent calls logged for debugging
```

## üìã STEP 4: Create Audit Results Folder (1 min)

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/audit_results
```

This is where Claude Code will save audit reports.

---

## üöÄ STEP 5: Run Your First Audit (10 min)

Open Claude Code and run:

```
Run a comprehensive structural audit of the Green Man Tavern Phoenix 
LiveView + MindsDB codebase. Generate a detailed report covering:

PART 1: CODEBASE OVERVIEW
- Directory structure and file organization
- All LiveView modules (count, purposes, patterns)
- All Context modules (count, what they manage)
- Identify dead code or orphaned files
- Module dependency graph (any circular dependencies?)

PART 2: DATABASE SCHEMA INTEGRITY
- List all tables, their purposes, and which Context manages them
- Verify all foreign keys have ON DELETE strategies
- Check for missing indexes on foreign keys
- Identify normalized vs denormalized tables
- Find any tables not used by any code

PART 3: SECURITY & DATA ACCESS
- How is current_user determined across the app?
- Are all user-scoped queries filtering by user_id?
- Can user A access user B's data? (if so: CRITICAL issue)
- Any raw SQL queries that could have injection risks?
- Character agent data access: can agents see other users' data?

PART 4: ARCHITECTURE CONSISTENCY
- Are all LiveViews following LiveView ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Database pattern?
- Do all Contexts return {:ok, data} / {:error, reason}?
- Are all HTTP handlers properly protected?
- Do all user-facing features reference current_user?

PART 5: THE SEVEN SEEKERS SYSTEM
- Are all seven characters fully implemented?
- Do all characters have personality data for agent prompts?
- Is trust system properly tracked?
- Are character pages consistently styled?

PART 6: SYSTEMS FLOW DIAGRAM (LIVING WEB)
- Is database schema properly storing nodes and connections?
- Are there tests verifying the diagram integrity?
- Is opportunity detection algorithm implemented?
- Are all system types properly categorized?

PART 7: TESTING COVERAGE
- Total test count and coverage percentage
- Which Contexts have no tests?
- Which LiveViews have no tests?
- Are there integration tests covering full user journeys?

PART 8: NAMING CONVENTIONS
- Are all modules named GreenManTavern.Domain.Module?
- Are all LiveViews named with Live suffix?
- Are all tables named snake_case plural?
- Are all functions snake_case?

PART 9: DOCUMENTATION
- Does each module have @moduledoc?
- Do public functions have @doc with examples?
- Is the architecture documented?
- Is there a README for developers?

OUTPUT: Create a structured report with:
- Status for each section (pass/warning/critical)
- Specific issues found with line numbers/file paths
- Top 10 priorities ranked by severity
- Recommendations for each issue

Save the full report to: .claude/audit_results/initial_audit.md
```

---

## üéØ STEP 6: Process the Results (5 min)

After Claude Code runs:

1. **Read the output** (will be very detailed)
2. **Identify CRITICAL issues** (üî¥ ‚Äî fix immediately)
3. **Create tickets** for High-priority issues (üü°)
4. **Note Medium/Low priorities** (üü¢ ‚Äî nice to have)

Update your `AUDIT_BASELINE.md` with key findings.

---

## üìÖ STEP 7: Schedule Ongoing Checks

Add these to your calendar:

### Weekly (Every Monday at 9:00 AM)
```
"Run weekly health check in Claude Code"
- Takes 5 minutes
- Identify any new issues
```

### Bi-Weekly (Every Thursday at 9:00 AM)
```
"Run architecture drift check in Claude Code"
- Takes 10 minutes
- Verify patterns still being followed
```

### Monthly (1st of month at 9:00 AM)
```
"Run full integration test in Claude Code"
- Takes 15 minutes
- Test complete user journey
```

### Quarterly (End of each quarter)
```
"Run deep audit in Claude Code"
- Takes 30 minutes
- Compare to baseline, identify trends
```

## üìä Example: What a Report Looks Like

Claude Code will produce something like:

```
AUDIT REPORT: Green Man Tavern Initial Audit
Date: 2025-01-20
Status: üü° ATTENTION NEEDED

PART 1: CODEBASE OVERVIEW
‚úÖ Directory structure well organized
‚úÖ 12 LiveView modules identified
‚úÖ 8 Context modules identified
‚ö†Ô∏è Found 2 orphaned files: old_character_page.ex, legacy_form.ex
‚ö†Ô∏è Found 1 circular dependency: SystemsContext ‚Üí CharsContext ‚Üí SystemsContext

PART 2: DATABASE SCHEMA
‚úÖ 13 tables, all with timestamps
‚úÖ All foreign keys have ON DELETE CASCADE
‚ö†Ô∏è Missing index on user_systems.user_id (queried frequently)
‚ö†Ô∏è user_connections.user_id index exists but missing on type+user_id composite

PART 3: SECURITY & DATA ACCESS
‚ö†Ô∏è UserSystems LiveView: Queries systems but doesn't verify user ownership
üî¥ CRITICAL: Direct Ecto.Repo query in CharacterLive - bypasses Context
‚ö†Ô∏è MindsDB context builder: Could expose other user's systems in rare cases

... [continued detailed analysis] ...

TOP 10 PRIORITIES:
1. üî¥ CRITICAL: Fix CharacterLive direct database query (1 hour)
2. üî¥ CRITICAL: Add user_id filter to UserSystems query (30 min)
3. üü° HIGH: Remove circular dependency (2 hours)
4. üü° HIGH: Add composite index on user_connections (15 min)
5. üü° HIGH: Test MindsDB context for data leaks (1 hour)
6. üü° HIGH: Add @doc comments to 15 public functions (1.5 hours)
7. üü† MEDIUM: Delete 2 orphaned files (5 min)
8. üü† MEDIUM: Add test for user isolation (1 hour)
9. üü† MEDIUM: Document Seven Seekers system (30 min)
10. üü¢ LOW: Add Monica theme to README (15 min)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Fix the 3 critical/high items immediately
- Schedule 2-hour refactoring session this week
- Add security tests to CI pipeline
- Document architecture patterns
```

## üéØ Quick Reference: What to Do When

### When you write code:
```
"Does this follow .claude/project_standards.md?"
- Use LiveView ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Database pattern?
- Filter by current_user_id for user data?
- Have tests?
- Documented?
```

### Before committing:
```
"Run quick code review in Claude Code"
```

### Every Monday morning:
```
"Run weekly health check in Claude Code"
```

### Before deploying to production:
```
"Run pre-deployment checklist in Claude Code"
```

### When something feels messy:
```
"Run refactoring guidance in Claude Code"
```

### When a user reports a bug:
```
"Run security audit in Claude Code" (to ensure it's not a data leak)
"Run custom module audit in Claude Code" (for the affected module)
```

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Q: Claude Code says "Module not found" or "File not found"
**A**: Claude Code needs to be able to see your file structure. Make sure your repository root is clean (no node_modules, build artifacts) and all code is in lib/, test/, priv/ directories.

### Q: Audit takes a long time
**A**: Normal for first audit (~2-5 min). Subsequent audits are faster. You can run audits during breaks.

### Q: Claude Code output is overwhelming
**A**: Focus on the CRITICAL issues (üî¥) first. High-priority (üü°) in the next sprint. Medium/Low (üü¢) can be batched for tech debt days.

### Q: How do I know if I should deploy?
**A**: Check the Pre-Deployment Checklist report. If it says "üî¥ DO NOT DEPLOY" ‚Äî don't. If "‚úÖ SAFE TO DEPLOY" or "‚ö†Ô∏è WITH CAUTION" ‚Äî proceed as documented.

### Q: What if I disagree with a recommendation?
**A**: Document it in `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`. Keep notes on decisions made. Share with team if applicable.

### Q: Can I run audits on just one module?
**A**: Yes! Use the "CUSTOM: Check Specific Module" prompt in the Claude Code prompts document. Specify the module name.
